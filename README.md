# Elixir tutorial
This is the code of the [Introduction to Mix](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) elixir tutorial.

To run the tests go in the kv_umbrella folder and run `iex --sname node2 -S mix`, 
then, from the same folder but in a different terminal, run `elixir --sname node1 -S mix test`.

The node names are hardcoded, you might want to change them before running the test, or you can change your hostname to align with mine, as you prefer.
